						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Synopsis:</strong> 
							Comedy series about a tight-knit group of friends living in Manhattan. It also covers their interactions with their families, 
							their lovers, and various colleagues over a period of several years.The series opens with runaway bride Rachel Green, who has 
							just abandoned her fiance Barry Farber at the altar. Having no place to stay in New York City, she manages to locate Monica 
							Geller. Monica used to be Rachel's best friend during their high school year, though they have not seen each other in several 
							years. Rachel convinces Monica to take her in as her new roommate. They rekindle their friendship.Rachel used to be a "daddy's 
							girl" who relied entirely on her wealthy father to cover her expenses. Having lost his favor, she gets her first real job as a 
							waitress at the coffeehouse Central Perk. She has no actual skill at her job, but her manager Gunther has fallen for her and 
							never fires her. In later seasons, Rachel is able to find a more lucrative job in a fashion company.Monica is a hardworking chef, 
							who owns her own apartment. She is good at her job, but has men-related problems in her personal life. She also has her share of 
							psychological problems, including an obsession with cleanliness, unreasonable levels of competitiveness and frequent signs of 
							obsessive-compulsive behavior. Additional issues explored in the series involve her traumatic memories of her childhood obesity, 
							and her poor relationship with her mother, who always criticizes her.The third member of the group is Ross Gellar, Monica's older 
							brother. He is a paleontologist, who is trying to recover from the abrupt end of his first marriage. His wife Carol Willick came 
							out as a lesbian, and moved in with her lover Susan Bunch. Ross and Carol have a son, Ben. Ross tries to be a good parent, but 
							does not have full custody over him. Meanwhile, he pursues relationships with various women, and tries to advance his career.In 
							later seasons, Ross impulsively marries twice, leading to two more divorces. His string of failed marriages somewhat damages his 
							self-esteem. As explored throughout the series, he was always his parents' favorite and he had an inflated ego.The fourth member 
							of the group is Chandler Bing, a lifelong friend of Ross. He works as a statistical analyst at a company. He resents his job, 
							though it pays well and he is typically more affluent than his friends. He has a sarcastic sense of a humor. He is rather 
							effeminate in behavior, though he is upset when people keep assuming that he is homosexual.As explored in the series, Chandler is 
							the son of celebrity parents. His father is drag queen performer Charles Bing, a fixture of Las Vegas show business. His mother 
							is erotic novelist Nora Tyler Bing, highly successful in her field. He grew up exposed to their respective sex lives, and their 
							eccentricities. He has had more than his share of traumatic experiences and personal insecurities, and typically uses humor as a 
							self-defense mechanism.The fifth member of the group is struggling actor Joey Tribbiani. He starts the series as Chandler's 
							roommate and the two have a closer relationship to each other than anyone else. Joey experiences the unsteady nature of his 
							profession, with relatively few high-profile roles and frequent periods of unemployment.Joey is depicted as rather dim-witted, 
							but gregarious and quite charming. He is a ladies' man, and typically picks up dates or has sex more frequently than anyone else 
							in the group. He has relatively few serious relationships. In his relations to others, he demonstrates a protective streak. He 
							can act as a surrogate brother to his friends.The sixth member of the group is Phoebe Buffay, Monica's former roommate. She works 
							as a masseuse and self-taught folk musician. Phoebe's mother committed suicide when Phoebe was 14-years-old. Phoebe has mostly 
							fended for herself ever since, and reportedly committed a few crimes while living as a street kid. Grown-up Phoebe has instead 
							become a pacifist, a vegetarian, and a tree hugger. She has picked up a few New Age ideas and superstitions, such as believing in 
							spirits and reading in tea-leaves. To Ross' annoyance, Phoebe does not believe in the theory of evolution. Despite having little 
							formal education, Phoebe is apparently fluent in French and Italian.Subplots involving Phoebe involve her relations with 
							surviving members of her family, such as the father who abandoned her, and a kid brother who relies on her for help. Phoebe also 
							has an identical twin sister, Ursula, who seemingly hates Phoebe for unknown reasons.

							Jay Pritchett sits at the head of a large, unconventional family. Now in his second marriage to gorgeous young wife Gloria, Jay

							culture clashes and a few misunderstandings, but also plenty of sweet victories along the way. Jay's grown daughter Claire and 
							her husband Phil are the proud parents of three kids with whom they want that open, healthy, honest relationship. It's not always 
							easy, especially when you have Haley, a teenage daughter who's growing up a little fast; Alex, a too-smart-for-her-own-good 
							middle daughter; and Luke, a scatterbrained boy. Add to this that Phil is just a big kid himself, even if he does always have the 
							best intentions. Claire is the anchor, trying her best to run a tight ship and determined not to let her kids have the rebellious 
							childhood she had. Claire's brother Mitchell and his partner Cameron are busy raising their adopted daughter Lily. Opposites 
							attract in this household, with Cameron having a wonderfully big personality and maybe a flare for the dramatic, while Mitchell 
							is more buttoned-down. These doting fathers balance each other out and relish their roles as parents developing their own little 
							family.

							Evelyn and various other friends and family. Other fairly regular characters include Charlie's cleaning lady Berta and his rich,

							<strong>Synopsis:</strong> 
							Johnny and Moira Rose are nouveau riche, their wealth largely from Johnny's video store empire, the second-largest in North 
							America. With that wealth, Moira was able to put her life as a daytime soap-opera actress behind her. As they have always led a 
							garish life of excessive wealth, their now-adult offspring, David and Alexis, have been spoiled, not knowing anything but having 
							whatever they wanted handed to them on a silver platter their entire lives, and not having had to work a day in their lives. 
							Their collective lives change when out of circumstance they end up broke except for the one asset Johnny bought for David years 
							earlier as a joke: a small backwater town called Schitt's Creek. The Roses are forced to move there, initially living in the 
							Schitt's Creek Motel. The town's founding family, the Schitts, still largely control the town in their seemingly unsophisticated 
							ways. The Roses do whatever they can to find a way back to their previous life, but in the meantime have to try to eke out a life 
							in their new home, which is totally outside their sensibilities.
